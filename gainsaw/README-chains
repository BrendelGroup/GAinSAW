The Chain Format is described here:
	https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/chain.html

HOWEVER:
  A chain file like aToB.over.chain.gz is meant to convert "a" coordinates
to "B" coordinates, according to
	https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/liftOver/
which states

"The file names reflect the assembly conversion data contained within
in the format <db1>To<Db2>.over.chain.gz. For example, a file named
hg15ToHg16.over.chain.gz file contains the liftOver data needed to
convert hg15 (Human Build 33) coordinates to hg16 (Human Build 34)."

Thus, the description of the Chain Format as per chain.html is peculiar
and confusing (to us) with respect to "target" and "query"; according to
	http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Chains_Nets
this is "chain and net lingo."

THEREFORE:
  Our code will interpret the chain header lines as

chain score qName qSize qStrand qStart qEnd tName tSize tStrand tStart tEnd id

That is to say, the first coordinate set responds to the "query" genome (i.e.,
hg15 in the example above), and the second coordinate set responds to the
"target" genome (i.e., Hg16 in the example above). This is consistent with
the chain files analyzed: the first coordinate set is always with qStrand = "+",
whereas the second set shows mapping to the target on either "+" or "-" strand.


Chain coordinate to GenBank coordinate mapping
  The chain coordinates are given according to the following description from
https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/chain.html:

"The alignment start and end positions are represented as zero-based half-open
intervals. For example, the first 100 bases of a sequence would be represented
with start position = 0 and end position = 100, and the next 100 bases would be
represented as start position = 100 and end position = 200. When the strand
value is '-', position coordinates are listed in terms of the
reverse-complemented sequence."

For mere mortals, it is easier to comprehend the coordinates in the GenBank
style (numbering relative to the database '+' strand, starting from 1). The
requisite translation is as follows:

qStart, qEnd              	=>	qStart + 1, qEnd
tStrand = '+', tStart, tEnd	=>	tStart + 1, tEnd
tStrand = '-', tStart, tEnd	=>	tSize - tEnd + 1, tSize - tStart

For example, the UCSC file hg38ToRheMac10.over.chain has the following entries
(note, the in macaque, human chromosomes 20 and 22 are fused to macaque chromosome 10):

chain 4902 chr22 50818468 + 32351421 32351697 chr10 99517758 + 30874275 30874555 99107
chain 39753 chr22 50818468 + 32141527 32145185 chr10 99517758 - 72808263 72810332 22038

The target (macaque) sequence for the second chain is chr10, from
	99517758 - 72810332 + 1 = 26707427
to
	99517758 - 72808263a    = 26709495
(with the match being the reverse complement of the segment).
