  We provide a set of testXY.py scripts to illustrate use of gainsaw.  Each
  script comes with documentation explaining the code.

  We suggest you run
    python testXY.py > outXY
  and then read the output file outXY.
  
  This preparatory test simply checks whether you have access to the gainsaw
  package. If
    import gainsaw
  fails, please go back to the GAinSAW documentation on github.
  For a thorough introduction to gainsaw, the test scripts should be run in
  order.
