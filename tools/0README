# The xtidyGFF script relies on the canon-gff3 executable from the AEGeAn package
# (https://github.com/BrendelGroup/AEGeAn). You can either install the AEGeAn
# package, or you can let xtidyGFF invoke canon-gff3 via the GAinSAW.sif
# singularity image file.

# Please see https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/main/installation.html on how to
# install apptainer on your system. For some OS, package installers can do
# this; e.g., Fedora: dnf install apptainer.

# Get the GAinSAW.sif container as follows:
#

wget https://BrendelGroup.org/SingularityHub/GAinSAW.sif

# We also make use of the following UCSC tools. You may decide to install the
